# SearchExerciser

Python package to exercise search algorithms.

The following algorithms are implemented to solve maze and graph search problems:
- blind search: depth-first, breadth-first, non-deterministic, and iterative deepening;
- heuristic search: hill climbing, greedy and beam search;
- optimal search: uniform cost, optimal uniform cost, optimal uniform cost with branch-and-bound, estimate-extended uniform cost, and A*.

Check the notebooks for examples.

Required packages: NumPy, MatplotLib, Networkx, IPython

SearchExerciser is developed by Stefaan Haspeslagh and Andy Louwyck at Vives University of Applied Sciences (Kortrijk, Belgium).
